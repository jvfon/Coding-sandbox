# Variables
## Declaring a variable

keywords: `var`, `let`, `const`

`var first = 'wes';`

first: the variable name.  
wes: a string.

The variable with the name 'first' has the value of 'wes'.  

`let age = 30;`

`const = true;`

Use ';' to terminate a statement.  

## Differences between var, let and const

`var` and `let` can be updated.  

example:
`var first = 'door';`  
`first = 'chair';`

The variable 'first' value changes from 'door' to 'chair'.   
There is no need to declare the variable again with 'var'.  

As a general rule, `const` variables can't be updated.  

## Scoping

`var` variables are function scope variables.  
`let` and `const` variables are block scope variables.

## Naming convention
